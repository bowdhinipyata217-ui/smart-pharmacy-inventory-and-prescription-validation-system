# 💊 Pharmacy AI Management System

A full-stack AI-powered pharmacy management web application built with Django (Python) backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. This system uses OCR and AI to extract medicine names from prescription images and automatically check inventory availability.

It intelligently identifies if a prescribed medicine is available in the inventory. If not available, it suggests alternative medicines, aiding pharmacists in efficient inventory and prescription management.
